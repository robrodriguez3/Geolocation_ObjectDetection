# Geolocation ObjectDetection
Estimate geographic coordinates of objects detected with Tensorflow Deep Neural Networks.\
Contains two code bases:\
-Geolocation in Image: For object detection in a directory of images which will estimate the coordiantes of the object(s) based on image EXIF and XMP metadata.
-Geolocation in Orthomosaic: For object detection in an orthomosaic which will estimate the coordinates of the object(s) based on GIS metadata.
